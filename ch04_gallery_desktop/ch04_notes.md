# Mastering Qt 5

## Chapter 4 - Desktop Gallery

This chapter puts the work in chapter 3 to use, crafting a desktop GUI for our gallery based on the gallery\_core library.

### Qt Classes to Familiarize With

At the end of last chapter we were introduced to the `QAbstractListModel` and the `QModelIndex` type. These are new to me and deserve some reading time. Knowing that they tie into the Qt Model/View architecture I saved this exploration for this chapter. Along with these there are still more new classes to look into, the first of which being the `QIdentityProxyModel`.
