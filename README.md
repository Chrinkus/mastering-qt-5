## Current Status:

*Dec 28, 2018*
Working on initial pass through the book. Although this text does not contain any exercises or problem solving situations to work through, I will be typing out the project codes and ensuring they run on Windows, Mac and Linux. After the first two chapters of doing this I have already learned a lot about building and running in Qt.

I will also keep a `notes.md` file for each chapter to comment on points of interest throughout.
